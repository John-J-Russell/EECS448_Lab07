BUG GUESSES:
1) addBack() is broken and does not work. It does increment size though.
2) removeFront() is broken, instead removes from back.
3) isEmpty() is broken, as it would appear list begins with m_size 1, though having no nodes.
4) size() is broken, as it would appear list begins with m_size 1, though having no nodes.
