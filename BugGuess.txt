Best guess for bug causes:
1) list size starts at one, despite list being empty.
	Is this two bugs? As m_size seems to begin as 1.
2) addBack broken, but does increment size
3) removeFront instead removes from the back.
4)

do removeFront and removeBack do the same thing?
removeBack decrements size, but if no nodes are present, does not abort.

Check size decrementation

THINGS TESTED:
AddFront appears to work, unless it adds to the back. No, yeah, it works.
